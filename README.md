Butterflies are beautiful, winged insects known for their vibrant colors and graceful flight. They belong to the order Lepidoptera and undergo a complete metamorphosis, transforming from eggs to caterpillars, then pupae, before emerging as adults. Butterflies play a crucial role in pollination, helping flowers reproduce while feeding on nectar. Found in diverse habitats worldwide, they use their striking patterns for camouflage or to warn predators. Their delicate yet fascinating life cycle makes them a symbol of transformation, beauty, and resilience in nature.
